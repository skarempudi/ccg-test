This is an in-progress work with the aim to model the combat system of a collectible card game like Magic: the Gathering.

Currently, I am still experimenting with the UI, and no game mechanics have been implemented yet.

At this point, this is best viewed as a showcase of my experimenting with RxJava, Dagger 2, and Data Binding.
