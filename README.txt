This is an in-progress work with the aim to model the combat system of a collectible card game like Magic: the Gathering.

Currently, I am still experimenting with the UI, and no game mechanics have been implemented yet.

At this point, this is best viewed as a showcase of my experimenting with RxJava, Dagger 2, and Data Binding.

The bottom row represents the hand, the row above land resource cards, and the row above creature cards.
Touching the creature cards will result in them rotating 90 degrees (tapping), and returning to normal on a second touch.
